# TacoDot

![Overview](doc/overview.png)

This repo fullfills two purposes:
* Of course this is my personal backup - if something happens to my precious ;)
* For everyboy who likes my setup and wants to use it him/herself

For some people the colors will truly be shocking. I personally enjoy it a bit
more "trashy" so don't hate! The colors are all taken from a syntax theme that I
personally enjoy: [Panda](https://panda.siamak.work/). All of the provided
config files are obviously easiest to use by just symlinking at their correct
spot.

Just for people that care: I am using this setup on an 2015 MacBook Pro running
Arch.
